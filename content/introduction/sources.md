(super-rough-draft right now -s9)

Credit where credit is due:

*   Pendragon 1st edition -- the basic d20-against-skill-number mechanic, with the
    additional cleverness of the way criticals are handled
    
*   From Harnmaster:

    *   The four-level (CF, F, S, CS) matrix (A vs. B)
    *   Lots of stuff from the armor and combat sections

*   Also from Pendragon -- passions, loyalties, loves, etc.

*   From Aria, and from Burning Wheel -- the concept of characters being a layer-cake
    of kinship, career, environs, etc.

*   From Aria, and Harnmaster, the detailed combat you vs. me actions and reactions.
    
*   From Star Fleet Battles (oh yes), the impulse phasing turn counter whatever thing.

*   From Twilight 2000, the Coolness Under Fire and Hesitation mechanic.

*   Some kind of combination of Legend of the Five Rings and Harnmaster for attributes --
    there's so much there to love, e.g.:
    
    *   Maybe use the Five Elements as the basis for the stats, like it LotFR, and/or
        also link them to the context elements -- Earth is heritage, etc.
        
    *   The Fifth Element, Void, is the character themselves -- the unique path.
    
    *   Each of the other four produces two attributes, just like in LotFR, except
        I want twelve attributes, closer to Harnmaster, with eight pairs mental/physical,
        plus the four sense attributes. (need to work on these a bit)
        
    *   (Maybe I'm reaching a bit -- maybe leave the LotFR ring stuff for the Hidden
        Spirits project later on?)
        
    *   (Yeah, this system is medieval, so it needs to be alchemistic, four elements
        and three principles, plus the Quintessence.)
        
*   Also from Harnmaster and/or Aria: three traits averaged (1-20) to give your Base, then
    pips/stars/levels/whatever of Training as a multiplier (1-5), to give you a 1-100 value
    for your Ability.  Divide by 5 to pull it back into the Pendragon d20 mechanic.
    
*   (Something else to save for Hidden Spirits -- fluidity of initiative, going up and
    down throughout a fight at things happen, to represent momentum, positive or negative.)
    
*   (Do I want to use Skill Trees?  I can't even remember where I've seen them before...
    1st ed Paranoia?  other places?)
