# Overview

(super-rough-draft -mgs)

This is the game I always wanted to play.

Things I love:

*   Front-loaded crunchy mechanics
*   Fast combat resolution
*   Grim combat outcomes

I make no excuses for my choices as to what to combine to make this game, since it's the game
I always wanted to play, not necessarily the game anyone else ever wants to play.
